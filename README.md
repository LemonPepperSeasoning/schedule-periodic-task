# Schedule Periodic Task

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This repository explores various implementations of a task scheduler in Python, with a focus on scheduling periodic tasks. The primary objective is to investigate methods for minimizing or eliminating drift during the scheduled tasks.

## Best Implementation

**[Best Implementation Method Summary]**

[Provide a concise summary of the best implementation method at the top.]

## Experiments and Results

### Experiment Overview

The repository conducts extensive experiments to assess the reliability of each implementation method. Key metrics include:

- **Drift Measurement:** Analyze the total drift observed over extended periods (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
- **Asynchronicity:** Explore the feasibility of implementing tasks asynchronously.

### Results

#### Drift Measurement

[Present the results of the drift measurement experiments, including any observations or patterns.]

### Acknowledgments

[Optional: Acknowledge any external resources, libraries, or contributors who influenced or supported the project.]
